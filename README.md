# Is Gravity Still Working?

Yup.

### Inspiration
IsGravityStillWorking.com was a joke made by Kate-Laurel Agnew in a Slack channel, which led to me immediately purchasing the domain so that I could bring it into existance.

Inspired by the internet of yesteryear, its reminiscent of what was once an internet culture treasure - [You're the Man Now Dog](http://www.ytmnd.com).  

### The Code
IGSW is a single function script, which randomly chooses a gif to display and appends it to the div.

The layout was done with a simple `display:flex, flex-direction: column; align-items: center`

Text effects and animation come from a snippet from [15 Awesome CSS3 Text Effects](http://www.webappers.com/2015/09/03/15-awesome-css3-text-effects/) which was slightly customized to better suit my use.

### Thanks!
Thanks [Chicago Web Friends](http://www.chicagofriends.website/) for being an inspiring group of people, joking about this website, and laughing when I made it.
